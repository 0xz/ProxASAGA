# ProxASAGA

Code that implements the proximal asynchronous SAGA (ProxASAGA) method described in XXX.

## Compatibility

The code depends on the following tools and libraries:

 Â * gcc (clang will probably work too but you'll need to edit the Makefile accordingly).
  * The following python libraries: [cffi python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cffi?), NumPy and SciPy.

The code has been tested on OSX and Linux.

## Usage

The algorithmic parts are implemented in C++. To use the code, first type `make` from the command line. That should compile the code and generate a binary file called ```libasaga.so```. Once this is done you can launch the example in prox_asaga:

```bash
$ python prox_asaga.py
```
This script trains a logistic regression model using ProxASAGA on 1, 2, 3 and 4 processors respectively. If everything worked fine, after ~10 minutes you should see a matplotlib plot like this:

![]()

## Other implementations

C-OPT contains a pure Python implementation (using Numba) of the sequential algorithm. Note that because Numba lacks atomic types, a pure Python implementation is not straightforward.
